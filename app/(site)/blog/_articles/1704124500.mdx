As a developer, I assume you use GitHub everyday. (If not, you wouldnâ€™t be reading this)

I recommend enabling all beta features because they are generally better additions. If not, just give feedback, as that's what beta testing is for.

The steps are easy, as quoted from [the official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/exploring-early-access-releases-with-feature-preview#exploring-beta-releases-with-feature-preview).

> 1. In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click **Feature preview**.
> 2. To view details for a feature, in the left sidebar, click the feature's name.
> 3. Optionally, to the right of a feature's name, click **Enable** or **Disable**.
