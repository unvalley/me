## You can hire me

I'm currently working for a Japanese company based in Tokyo.

For the following reasons, I am looking for a software engineer position at an overseas company:

- I mostly write TypeScript, Rust and Documents
- I'm a fan of Open Source
    - contribute to [biomejs/biome](https://github.com/biomejs/biome) (ex. rome/tools) as a core contributor
    - contribute to Rust ecosystems (rust-clippy, rust-analyzer) a few times
    - check my contribution from [my profile](https://github.com/unvalley)
    - explore GitHub [to leave a bunch of stars for great projects](https://github.com/unvalley?tab=stars)
- I like safety development and developer experience
- I know how comment and documentation is important for sustainable development
- I have experience in SaaS (community platform, data-ops platform) and Ad (digital signage)
- I love collaborating with cool people on cool projects!
