iow: true by default

In today’s fast-paced dev environment, we rely on a wide range of tools—editors, editor extensions, cli, web services, programming languages, AI agents and more—to get the job done.

I’d prefer those tool options to be set to "enabled" by default whenever possible (and clearly indicated). Since most tools come with various options, it’s hard to check all their settings in detail. Even though the tool might already include the feature the user wanted, lengthy documentation may cause that feature to be overlooked for years. Not every feature needs to be enabled by default, but almost should be. Moreover, if a tool has too many features that can be toggled, that's a design mistake.
