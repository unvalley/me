Computer fans stay home even when the weather is nice.
Let’s create a few reasons to step outside.

## 1. Have a good camera

Taking photos with a smartphone and with a real camera feels totally different.
With a good camera, even the most ordinary places turn into great subjects.

I recommend carrying the lightest good camera you can find.
If the camera itself is heavy, it becomes one more reason not to go outside.
Starting with a pocket-sized compact camera is a great option.

I bought a SIGMA fp, one of the lightest full-frame mirrorless cameras.
But with a lens attached, it goes over 700g — and it definitely feels heavy.

## 2. Wear clothes that express who you are

Many computer fans don't care much about what they wear.
UNIQLO, GU, MUJI, they get the job done. I get it.

But wearing clothes that reflect who you are can lift your mood.
They don't have to be expensive, but good pieces often carry a bit of history.

## 3. Recognize the health benefits

Going outside means moving your body.
You need focused indoor time to build things, but walking or running helps you stay consistent.

People say your body is your biggest asset.
Still, creating a mental reset at home is surprisingly hard (Think about meditation, how many people actually keep it up?).

Try walking or running without music or podcasts once in a while.
You might find you can think more clearly than you ever do at home.
