I love Arc'teryx. Because they achieve the perfect balance between function and design.
Here is my Arc'teryx collection.

- Beta Jacket (Black)
- Gamma SV Jacket (Black)
- Atom LT Jacket (Black)
- Gamma Vest (Black)
- Skyline Shirt SS (Black)
- Skyline Shirt SS (White)
- Skyline Shirt LS (Black)
- Mantis 32 Backpack (Black)
- Mantis 2 Waist Pack (Black)
- Gore 5 Panel Hat (Black)
- Conveyor Belt 32mm
- Bird Head Toque (Black)
- DELTA ROO FLEECE (Blue)
- Ion Gear Organizer (Black)
- Kragg SL Cotton LS (Black)


Small Notes:

- Beta Jacket is enough.
- Gamma SV Jacket is sick.
- Skyline Shirts are good to wear.
- Gore 5 Panel Hat (2024) is too small.
- I like Mantis 32 Backpack, but we cannot buy it anymore.

Anyway, Arc'teryx and GORE-TEX are the best. Let me know your favorite one.
