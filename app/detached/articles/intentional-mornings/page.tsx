        How you start your morning sets the tone for your entire day. Yet for many of us, the first thing 
        we do upon waking is reach for our phones—immediately flooding our minds with other people's 
        priorities, problems, and agendas. There's a better way.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-light mt-8 mb-4">The Phone-First Problem</h2>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        Studies show that 80% of smartphone users check their phones within 15 minutes of waking up. This 
        seemingly innocent habit has profound consequences. By starting our day in reactive mode—responding 
        to messages, scrolling through feeds, consuming news—we surrender our most mentally fresh hours to 
        the demands and distractions of the digital world.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        This reactive start creates a cascade effect. We begin the day feeling behind, anxious about 
        unread messages, and mentally scattered from consuming fragmented information. Instead of setting 
        our own agenda, we let our devices set it for us.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-light mt-8 mb-4">The Power of Protected Time</h2>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        Your morning hours are neurologically unique. After a night of sleep, your prefrontal cortex—
        responsible for planning, decision-making, and creative thinking—is refreshed and operating at 
        peak capacity. Cortisol levels are naturally elevated, providing energy and focus. This is your 
        brain's prime time.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        By protecting this time from digital intrusion, you can harness these peak mental resources for 
        activities that truly matter: reflection, planning, creative work, or simply being present with 
        yourself and your loved ones.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-light mt-8 mb-4">Designing Your Intentional Morning</h2>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        An intentional morning routine doesn't require waking at 4 AM or following a rigid schedule. It 
        simply means being deliberate about how you spend the first hour of your day. Here's a framework 
        for building your own:
      </p>

      <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded my-6">
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-3">The M.I.N.D. Framework</h3>
        <ul className="space-y-3">
          <li><strong>M - Movement:</strong> Gentle stretching, yoga, or a short walk to awaken your body</li>
          <li><strong>I - Intention:</strong> Set a clear focus or priority for the day</li>
          <li><strong>N - Nourishment:</strong> Mindful breakfast and hydration</li>
          <li><strong>D - Deep Work:</strong> Tackle your most important task before checking messages</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-light mt-8 mb-4">Creating Your Phone-Free Zone</h2>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        The key to a successful morning routine is making it easier to avoid your phone than to use it. 
        This requires both environmental design and habit substitution:
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-light mt-6 mb-3">Environmental Design</h3>
      
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Charge your phone outside your bedroom (use a traditional alarm clock)</li>
        <li>Create a "phone parking spot" in your home where devices stay until after your routine</li>
        <li>Place a book, journal, or meditation cushion where you'd normally reach for your phone</li>
        <li>Use physical barriers: put your phone in a drawer or another room</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-light mt-6 mb-3">Habit Substitution</h3>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        Nature abhors a vacuum. Simply trying to "not check your phone" rarely works. Instead, replace the 
        phone-checking habit with something equally easy but more beneficial:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Replace scrolling with reading a physical book</li>
        <li>Substitute social media with journaling</li>
        <li>Trade news consumption for meditation or breathing exercises</li>
        <li>Exchange email checking for a morning walk</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-light mt-8 mb-4">The Compound Effect</h2>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        The benefits of an intentional morning routine compound over time. A phone-free hour each morning 
        means 365 hours per year reclaimed for activities that align with your values. That's over two 
        full weeks of focused, intentional time.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        But the benefits extend beyond time. People who maintain intentional morning routines report:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Increased clarity and focus throughout the day</li>
        <li>Reduced anxiety and stress levels</li>
        <li>Better decision-making capabilities</li>
        <li>Improved relationships (from being present at breakfast)</li>
        <li>Greater sense of control over their lives</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-light mt-8 mb-4">Starting Small: The 10-Minute Morning</h2>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        If a full hour feels overwhelming, start with just 10 phone-free minutes. Use this time for one 
        simple activity: make your bed mindfully, enjoy your coffee without distraction, or write three 
        things you're grateful for. Success breeds success—once you experience the calm of an intentional 
        start, you'll naturally want to extend it.
      </p>

      <div className="bg-black text-white p-6 rounded mt-8">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-3 text-white">Your 7-Day Morning Transformation</h3>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2 text-sm">
          <li><strong>Day 1-2:</strong> Move your phone charger out of the bedroom</li>
          <li><strong>Day 3-4:</strong> Add 10 minutes of phone-free time after waking</li>
          <li><strong>Day 5-6:</strong> Introduce one intentional activity (journaling, stretching, etc.)</li>
          <li><strong>Day 7:</strong> Extend to 30 minutes and add a second activity</li>
        </ol>
        <p className="mt-4 text-sm">
          Track how you feel each day. Notice changes in your mood, focus, and overall wellbeing.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-light mt-8 mb-4">The Ripple Effect</h2>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        An intentional morning creates ripples throughout your day. When you start by honoring your own 
        priorities rather than reacting to others', you set a precedent. You remind yourself that you have 
        agency over your attention and time.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        This isn't about perfection. Some mornings will be rushed, some routines will be interrupted. 
        That's life. The goal is progress, not perfection—to more often than not begin your day with 
        intention rather than reaction.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Your morning routine is a daily vote for the kind of life you want to live. Each phone-free morning 
        is a small act of rebellion against the attention economy and a declaration of your values. Start 
        tomorrow. Start small. But start.
