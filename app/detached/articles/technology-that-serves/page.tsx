        Your smartphone contains more computing power than the systems that sent humans to the moon. Yet for 
        many of us, this incredible tool has become a source of distraction rather than empowerment. The key 
        to reclaiming control lies not in abandoning technology, but in configuring it to serve your goals.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-light mt-8 mb-4">The Default Settings Trap</h2>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        Out of the box, our devices are optimized for engagement, not for our wellbeing. Every default 
        setting—from notification permissions to home screen layouts—is designed to maximize the time we 
        spend interacting with our devices. But these defaults aren't destiny.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        By taking control of our device settings and app configurations, we can transform our technology 
        from a source of constant interruption into a powerful tool for achieving our goals. This isn't 
        about using technology less—it's about using it better.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-light mt-8 mb-4">Notification Triage: The First Line of Defense</h2>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        Notifications are the foot soldiers in the attention economy's war for your focus. Each ping is a 
        tiny hijacking of your attention, pulling you away from whatever you were doing. The solution? 
        Ruthless notification triage.
      </p>

      <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded my-6">
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-3">The Three-Tier Notification System</h3>
        <ul className="space-y-3">
          <li><strong>Tier 1 - Essential:</strong> Calls, critical work communications, emergency alerts</li>
          <li><strong>Tier 2 - Important but not urgent:</strong> Calendar reminders, task deadlines</li>
          <li><strong>Tier 3 - Everything else:</strong> Social media, news, promotional emails (all disabled)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Start by disabling all notifications, then selectively re-enable only those that truly serve you. 
        Remember: if everything is urgent, nothing is.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-light mt-8 mb-4">The Intentional Home Screen</h2>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        Your home screen is digital prime real estate. Every app icon is a potential rabbit hole, designed 
        to draw you in with its carefully crafted colors and badges. By reorganizing your home screen with 
        intention, you can create friction around distracting apps while making helpful tools more accessible.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-light mt-6 mb-3">The Minimalist Approach</h3>
      
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Keep only essential tools on your home screen (maps, calendar, notes)</li>
        <li>Remove all social media apps from the home screen</li>
        <li>Disable app badges for non-critical applications</li>
        <li>Use folders to hide apps you need but don't want to see constantly</li>
        <li>Consider using a minimal launcher that reduces visual clutter</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-light mt-8 mb-4">Automation for Focus</h2>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        Modern smartphones offer powerful automation features that can help protect your focus. Use these 
        tools to create an environment that automatically supports deep work and minimizes distractions.
      </p>

      <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded my-6">
        <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mb-3">Focus Mode Automation Ideas</h3>
        <ul className="space-y-2 text-sm">
          <li>• Schedule "Do Not Disturb" during your most productive hours</li>
          <li>• Set app limits that kick in during work hours</li>
          <li>• Create location-based triggers (e.g., silence notifications at the office)</li>
          <li>• Use time-based app restrictions for social media</li>
          <li>• Automate grayscale mode in the evening to reduce screen appeal</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-light mt-8 mb-4">The Power of Friction</h2>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        In UX design, friction is usually the enemy. But when it comes to managing digital distractions, 
        strategic friction can be your best friend. By making it slightly harder to access time-wasting apps 
        and easier to use productive tools, you can nudge yourself toward better digital habits.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-light mt-6 mb-3">Adding Helpful Friction</h3>
      
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Log out of social media apps after each use</li>
        <li>Remove saved passwords for distracting websites</li>
        <li>Use app blockers during focused work sessions</li>
        <li>Keep your phone in another room while working</li>
        <li>Enable "Ask to Buy" or screen time permissions even for yourself</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-light mt-8 mb-4">Building a Personal Tech Stack</h2>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        Instead of letting apps accumulate randomly, approach your digital tools like a craftsperson selecting 
        their instruments. Each app should have a clear purpose and earn its place on your device.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Regularly audit your apps, asking: Does this tool help me achieve my goals? Does it respect my time 
        and attention? If not, it's time to let it go.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-light mt-8 mb-4">The Path to Digital Empowerment</h2>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        Technology is a powerful servant but a dangerous master. By taking control of your digital environment—
        through intentional configuration, strategic friction, and regular audits—you can ensure that your 
        devices amplify your capabilities rather than fragment your focus.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Remember: the goal isn't to use technology less, but to use it more deliberately. When your digital 
        tools are configured to serve your purposes, technology becomes what it was always meant to be: an 
        extension of human capability, not a substitute for human intention.
      </p>
