"What apps do you use?" Every time I hear this question, I pause. Because sharing my tool stack isn't just listing software—it's expressing my philosophy and values about digital life. Today, I'll share the tools I use daily, why I chose each one, and how I use them consciously.

## Three Principles of Tool Selection

First, let me share my fundamental principles for choosing tools. These serve as a compass in the endless sea of apps:

1. **Single-purpose clarity:** Tools that do one thing exceptionally well
2. **Appropriate friction:** Balance between ease of use and conscious usage
3. **Data ownership:** Control over my own data

## Writing and Thinking Tools

### Obsidian - My Second Brain

At the center of my thinking is Obsidian. It's not just a note-taking app—it's a "garden of thought" where ideas connect and evolve. Being markdown-based and stored as local files gives me confidence that I'll have access 10 or 20 years from now.

The key is using Obsidian not as a place to "record everything" but as a place to "deepen thinking." Daily ephemeral notes go elsewhere; Obsidian nurtures only ideas worth contemplating.

### iA Writer - A Sanctuary for Focused Writing

I always use iA Writer for long-form writing. The reason is simple: absolutely no distractions. Focus mode dims everything except the current paragraph, letting me concentrate solely on the words. This article was drafted in iA Writer.

## Programming Environment

### Neovim + VS Code - Philosophy of Separation

For coding, I switch between Neovim and VS Code based on the task. Config file edits and quick fixes go to Neovim; large refactoring and debugging happen in VS Code. It's not about which is better—it's about using the right tool for the job.

With Vim keybindings in both, I can move between editors without breaking my flow. Keeping hands on the keyboard is more important than you might think for maintaining flow state.

### Warp - The Reinvented Terminal

I recently switched from iTerm2 to Warp after years of use. While the AI assistant and command palette are appealing modern features, what I love most is the concept of "blocks." Commands and their outputs are visually grouped, making terminal history much easier to navigate.

## Tools for Protecting Focus and Flow

### One Switch - Simple Focus Modes

This tool makes switching macOS focus modes effortless. One click from the menu bar toggles between "Writing Mode," "Coding Mode," and "Meeting Mode." Each mode allows different notifications and apps, instantly creating the optimal environment for each context.

### Session - Evolution of Pomodoro

More than a timer app. By recording and analyzing work sessions, I understand my productivity patterns. I discovered my peak focus hours are 9-11 AM, which I now protect as "sacred time."

## Information Management

### Readwise Reader - Bridging Reading and Learning

It aggregates articles, PDFs, newsletters, even Twitter threads in one place. But the real value is automatic syncing of highlights to Obsidian. What I read becomes raw material for thinking.

### Reeder 5 - Conscious Information Consumption

RSS might be old technology, but it's perfect for algorithm-free information consumption. Reeder 5's beautiful interface lets me digest information from chosen sources at my own pace.

## Communication Tools

### Spark Mail - Making Email an Ally

The "Smart Inbox" feature ensures only important emails catch my eye. Newsletters auto-sort to separate folders; only necessary emails trigger notifications. Instead of being controlled by email, I use email as a tool.

**My communication tool philosophy:**

- Async by default, sync only during scheduled times
- Minimal notifications, batch processing
- Set expectations about response times upfront
- Maintain separate emergency contact methods (phone numbers)

## Tools Supporting Creativity

### Figma - Visualizing Ideas

Even non-designers find Figma a powerful thinking tool. I use it to diagram complex ideas and create presentations. I minimize collaboration features, using it primarily as a personal visual thinking tool.

### Things 3 - Beautiful Task Management

After trying countless task managers, I settled on Things 3. The reason: perfect balance of complexity and simplicity. It handles project management yet displays today's tasks beautifully. The animation when completing tasks provides small hits of satisfaction.

## Healthy Relationship with Tools

These tools are important elements supporting my digital life. But tools are means, not ends. While trying new tools is fun, I follow these rules to avoid the "tool rabbit hole":

**30-Day Tool Adoption Rule:**

1. **Week 1:** Try basic features with free/trial version
2. **Week 2:** Test integration with existing workflows
3. **Week 3:** Reconsider if truly necessary or replaceable
4. **Week 4:** Purchase if valuable, delete if not
5. **Required:** Remove one old tool when adding new

## Beyond Tools

There's no perfect toolset. What matters is consciously choosing tools aligned with your values and purposes, mastering them, and most importantly, using tools rather than being used by them.

My tool list constantly evolves. I try new things, abandon what doesn't fit, and keep only what provides real value. This process itself is the practice of consciously designing digital life.

What tools do you use? What relationship have you built with them? Tool choice is life choice. I hope this article inspires you to reconsider your own digital environment.
