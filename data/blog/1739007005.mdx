iow: true by default

In today’s fast-paced development environment, we rely on a wide range of tools—editors, editor extensions, command-line interfaces, web services, programming languages, AI agents and more—to get the job done.

I’d prefer those tool options to be set to "enabled" by default whenever possible (and clearly indicated). Since most tools come with various options, it’s hard to check all their settings in detail. Even though the tool might already include the feature the user originally wanted, skipping the lengthy documentation could mean overlooking it for years. Not every feature needs to be enabled by default, but as many as possible should be. And if a tool has too many toggleable features, then that's a mistake in itself.
