## Overall of 2023

- Graduated from grad university and got a Mastersâ€™ degree
- Started a new job in Tokyo based company and relocated to Tokyo
- Embraced the challenge of learning new technologies for me (Scala, Kotlin, GraphQL, Android, AWS, etc.)
- Worked on OSS (especially Biome)
- Discovered a passion for Futsal (beginner level)
- Caught up on Premier League highlights (but not fullgames ðŸ˜‚)
- ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot changes our dev

## Problems

- Stagnant: I didn't get a sense of much growth.
- Weak sense of ownership (especially on work): I've been too focused on the code base that I'm responsible for.
- Irregular hours: Sleep and meal times are quite irregular.
- Point of effort: I want to make sure that I'm focusing my efforts on the right things.

## Theme for 2024

- Tidy lifestyle: especially sleep and meal!
- Expertise: Align with interests
- English: Take some exam, IELTS?
- Revenue: Itâ€™s not enough, so I have less time for open-source projects and other activities. I want to have more money and time to spare.

## Do in 2024 (Numerical targets are not decided yet)

- Gain weight and sleep regularly (wrote at 4:10 AM)
- Spread my favorite things
- Launch a personal project with full ownership
- Streamline my life to eliminate unnecessary burdens
- Use English more (I'm having trouble following the OSS discord channel!)
- Think about my career and take some action
- Participate in Futsal more

In 2023, the results were unsatisfactory in many respects. I am not performing well at work. But there is no particular excuse. I found my own issues to fix.

I couldn't contribute much to Biome's feature implementation this year. I need to build up my fundamentals.

Time will only solve so much. Not be pessimistic, be insensitive to failure, and avoid getting bogged down by trivialities.

I caught a cold during the holiday season and had no updates. As it heals, it will gradually become active. Thank you for all your help in 2023.
