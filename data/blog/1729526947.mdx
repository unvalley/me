I had the chance to speak at Vue Fes Japan 2024 for the [Next generation front-end crosstalk](https://vuefes.jp/2024/en#event).
The crosstalk members are:

- Evan You: creator of Vue.js/Vite
- Boshen Chen: creator of Oxc
- Sosuke Suzuki: maintainer of Prettier
- ota-meshi: maintainer of ESLint and many ESLint plugins
- Kia King Ishii: core member of Vue and VitePress
- unvalley (me): core member of Biome

I was nervous for weeks before the talk because the other members are so talented, but I think it turned out to be really interesting.
Evan and Boshen discussed some important topics, and I was able to share some of my thoughts as well.

Kia's simultaneous interpretation made the crosstalk possible, and I was amazed by his skill in facilitating the conversation and instantly remembering everything that was being discussed ðŸ˜…

Throughout the event, I had many great conversations with people like Anthony Fu, Vite core members, OSS developers, and more. I was really inspired by the hard work of so many talented people. Boshen's and Anthony's talks, in particular, were especially impressive. I can't wait to watch the archived recordings of these sessions.

Overall, I had a great time at Vue Fes Japan 2024.
Thanks to everyone inolved in the event!

I highly recommend attending next year, even if you are a React fanðŸ˜„
